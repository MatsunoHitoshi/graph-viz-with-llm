Provide a set of Nodes in the form [ENTITY, TYPE, PROPERTIES] and a set of relationships in the form [ENTITY1, RELATIONSHIP, ENTITY2, PROPERTIES]. 
Pay attention to the type of the properties, if you can't find data for a property set it to null. Don't make anything up and don't add any extra data. If you can't find any data for a node or relationship don't add it.
Only add nodes and relationships that are part of the schema. If you don't get any relationships in the schema only add nodes.
Do not include extra text in your response, but return only the data.

Alice is 25 years old and Bob is her roommate.

Attempt to extract as many Nodes and Relationships as you can.
It is important that the ENTITY_ID_1 and ENTITY_ID_2 exists as Nodes with a matching ENTITY_ID.
If you can't pair a Relationship with a pair of Nodes don't add it.
Don't make anything up and don't add any extra data.
When you find a Node or Relationship you want to add try to create a generic TYPE for it that  describes the entity you can also think of it as a label.
Nodes that are targets of Edges must also be defined as a Node.
